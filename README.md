# Implementation-of-Gradient-Descent-Algorithm-for-Linear-and-Logistic-Regressions

sgemm_product.csv is the dataset used for this project. This can also be downloaded from the UCI Repository mentioned in the project report.

The project has been carried out in python using Jupyter notebook, and the full code is available in "Gradient Descent Implementation Code.ipynb" file. 

The "Project Report" file contains the Machine Learning experimentations that were performed on the data set, provides results for the experimentations, and offers a small discussion section.
